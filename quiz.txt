Which of the following statements regarding the equilibrium constant is NOT true?
When K >> 1, the concentration of products is much greater than the concentrations of reactants at equilibrium.
When K << 1, the concentration of reactants is much greater than the concentrations of products at equilibrium.
When K = 1, the concentration of products and reactants at equilibrium are always equal.
When K = 1, the forward and reverse rate constants are always equal.

Consider the equilibrium, Cl2(g) + 2 NO(g) produces 2 NOCl(g). When 2.000 M NOCl is placed in a tank at 500.0 K and allowed to come to equilibrium, the equilibrium concentration of Cl2 is 0.979 M. Calculate Kc.

For the equilibrium 2 NOBr(g)  2 NO(g) + Br2(g), Kc = 1.56 x 10-3 at 300 K. Suppose 0.400 M NOBr is placed in a reaction vessel at 300 K. At a given point, the concentration of Br2 is 0.0134 M. Which of the following statements is true?
Q < K so the reaction will continue to make more products.
Q > K so the reaction will consume products to make more reactants.
Q = K so the system is at equilibrium.
The value of K will decrease until it is equal to Q.
